# Sentiment Spice - Food Review Analyzer üå∂Ô∏è

A powerful sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for analyzing food reviews using advanced NLP models. This project combines VADER and RoBERTa models to provide accurate sentiment analysis for food-related text.

## Features

- **Dual Model Analysis**: Uses both VADER and RoBERTa models for comprehensive sentiment analysis
- **Food-Focused**: Optimized for food and dining experience reviews
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit-based web application
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant sentiment scoring with visual progress bars
- **Blended Results**: Combines both models for more accurate predictions

## Models Used

1. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**: Lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis
2. **RoBERTa**: Pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on Twitter sentiment data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnmolBansal10/Sentiment-Analyser-food-reviews-.git
cd Sentiment-Analyser-food-reviews-
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download NLTK data (if not already downloaded):
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

## Usage

### Streamlit Web App
Run the main application:
```bash
streamlit run app1.py
```

### HTML Interface
Open `sentiment_ananlyser.html` in your web browser for a static demonstration.

### Jupyter Notebook
Open `sentimental_ananlysis_try.ipynb` to explore the analysis process and model comparison.

## How It Works

1. **Text Input**: Users enter their food review text
2. **Food Detection**: The system checks if the text is food-related
3. **Dual Analysis**: Both VADER and RoBERTa models analyze the text
4. **Blended Results**: Results are combined using weighted averaging (VADER 40% + RoBERTa 60%)
5. **Visual Output**: Results are displayed with progress bars and sentiment indicators

## Example Usage

```python
# Example review
review = "The biryani was absolutely aromatic and delicious, a must-try!"

# The system will analyze this and provide:
# - VADER sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative, compound)
# - RoBERTa sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative)
# - Final blended result with confidence scores
```
